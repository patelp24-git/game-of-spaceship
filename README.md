## Technologies:

- Markdown
- Java
- processing
- Graphics and Textures

## Getting started: 

- Clone the repository
- Download the processing software [here](https://processing.org/download)
- Open the file `game.pde` and run the script.

## How to Navigate/Play:

 - When you first run the program, it will use an **orthographic projection** (not perspective). To switch to perspective mode, press the **SPACE** key.

 - To move the rocket, use the **UP**, **DOWN**, **RIGHT**, and **LEFT** arrow keys.

 - There are three types of obstacles: a **cube**, a **sphere**, and a **pyramid**. Depending on the height of the obstacle, the rocket will react differently when it collides with it. Try using the **UP** or **SIDE** keys to move the **rocket** if it gets hit by an obstacle.

 - The **rocket** has a special feature where it will start **rotating** whenever it collides with an **obstacle**, and it will continue to rotate until its motion is fixed.

 - There are a total of four textures available, each for a different line.
